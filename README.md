# Project Name: VenturePilot AI

## Project Overview

VenturePilot AI is a SaaS platform providing founders with comprehensive, AI-driven market intelligence and validation reports. It empowers data-backed decisions by analyzing startup ideas against market trends, competitor landscapes, and potential customer pain points, significantly de-risking the entrepreneurial journey from ideation to MVP.

**Mission:** To empower founders with data-driven insights, enabling them to validate their ideas, understand their markets, and increase their chances of success.

**Problem Solved:** Founders face high risks and failure rates due to a lack of accurate, comprehensive, and actionable market intelligence. They struggle with time-consuming manual research, identifying true customer pain points, accurately sizing their market, understanding competitor landscapes, and finding effective go-to-market strategies. This leads to launching products without product-market fit, wasting significant time and capital.

**Target User:** Aspiring and early-stage startup founders, solopreneurs, and small business owners who are in the ideation or early validation phase of their venture. They are typically tech-savvy, value data-driven decision-making, and are looking for efficient ways to validate their ideas before significant investment.

-   **business_analysis.md** - Complete business analysis including market positioning, monetization strategy, and competitive landscape. This document informs the overall strategy and target audience.
-   **prd.md** - Product Requirements Document with detailed feature specifications and user experience requirements. This document outlines the features, user flows, and design considerations for the application.
-   **technical_architecture.md** - Comprehensive technical architecture for the Next.js/Convex/Vercel stack. This document details the technology choices, database schema, API design, and overall system architecture.
-   **user_stories.md** - Detailed user stories and acceptance criteria for all features. This document describes the features from the user's perspective, guiding development and testing.

## Development Roadmap Checklist

### Phase 1: Project Foundation (Weeks 1-2)

-   [x] **(Human Task)** Initialize Next.js project with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
-   [x] **(Human Task)** Set up Convex backend and configure environment variables
-   [x] **(AI Task)** Generate initial database schema based on `technical_architecture.md`. This should include user accounts, reports, market data, and other core entities.  Consider using Convex's schema validation features.
-   [x] **(Human Task)** Implement authentication system (Convex Auth + Stripe Integration).  Integrate Convex Auth for secure user management and Stripe for payment processing.
-   [x] **(AI Task)** Create basic UI component library following design patterns from `prd.md`.  Generate reusable components for buttons, forms, and navigation.

### Phase 2: Core Feature Development (Weeks 3-6)

-   [x] **(AI Task)** Implement custom features as specified in `user_stories.md`. This will involve AI-powered market analysis, report generation, and recommendation engines.
-   [x] **(Human Task)** Set up payment processing (if applicable: complex) using Stripe integration. Implement subscription plans as described in `business_analysis.md`.
-   [x] **(AI Task)** Build standard features: `adminDashboard`, `analytics`, `apiIntegration`, `contentManagement`, `fileStorageProcessing`, `fileUploads`, `notifications`, `paymentProcessing`, `realTimeFeatures`, `scheduledTasks`, `userProfiles`. Leverage Convex functions and Next.js API routes for these features.
-   [x] **(Human Task)** Implement real-time functionality with Convex subscriptions for features like Dynamic Market Monitor updates.
-   [x] **(AI Task)** Create responsive UI components based on `technical_architecture.md` specifications, ensuring a consistent user experience across devices.

### Phase 3: Integration & Testing (Weeks 7-8)

-   [x] **(Human Task)** Set up automated testing framework (e.g., Jest with React Testing Library)
-   [x] **(AI Task)** Generate comprehensive test suites for all features, including unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests, covering all aspects of the application.
-   [x] **(Human Task)** Implement error handling and edge case management throughout the application.
-   [x] **(AI Task)** Optimize database queries and implement caching strategies to improve performance and reduce Convex function execution costs.
-   [x] **(Human Task)** Configure monitoring and analytics (e.g., Vercel Analytics, Sentry) to track application performance and user behavior.

### Phase 4: Deployment & Launch (Week 9)

-   [x] **(Human Task)** Set up production environment on Vercel. Configure the Vercel project with environment variables from `technical_architecture.md`.
-   [x] **(Human Task)** Configure custom domain and SSL certificates for the application.
-   [x] **(AI Task)** Generate SEO meta tags and OpenGraph data for all pages to optimize for search engines and social media sharing.
-   [x] **(Human Task)** Implement backup and disaster recovery procedures for both the Next.js frontend and the Convex backend.
-   [x] **(Human Task)** Launch application and monitor performance metrics using Vercel Analytics and any additional monitoring tools.

### Phase 5: Post-Launch Optimization (Ongoing)

-   [x] **(Human Task)** Collect user feedback and analytics data to identify areas for improvement and feature enhancements.
-   [x] **(AI Task)** Generate feature enhancement recommendations based on usage patterns and user feedback, prioritizing features that address the most common pain points.
-   [x] **(Human Task)** Implement A/B testing for key user flows to optimize conversion rates and user engagement.
-   [x] **(AI Task)** Optimize performance based on Core Web Vitals metrics, addressing any identified bottlenecks.
